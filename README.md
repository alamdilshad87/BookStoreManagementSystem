## Security Implementation

### Password Security
- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- PBKDF2 hashing with salt using Rfc2898DeriveBytes
- Secure password verification during login
- Salt generated for each password

### Authentication & Authorization
- Session-based user authentication
- Session tokens stored securely
- Role-based access control (User/Admin)
- Admin pages check user role before loading
- Logout clears session data
- Secure session management

### Best Practices
- Input validation on all forms
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Secure session handling
- Password hashing on registration and login

## User Workflows

2. Enters username, email, and password
3. Password is hashed with PBKDF2
4. User record created in database
5. Redirected to login page

### Login Flow
1. User enters credentials
